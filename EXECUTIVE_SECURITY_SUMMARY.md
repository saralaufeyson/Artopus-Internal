Your application has **8 critical security vulnerabilities** that need immediate attention.

Think of your application like a house:
- ❌ The front door lock is missing (authentication issues)
- ❌ Windows are unlocked (access control problems)
- ❌ Security alarm isn't set up (no monitoring)
- ❌ Valuables are visible from outside (data exposure)

**Fix:** Make login sessions expire after 7 days.

### 4. **User Data Visible to Other Users** ⏱️ 30 minutes
**What it means:** User A can see User B's artwork and information.
**Risk:** Privacy violation, potential data theft.
**Fix:** Add ownership checks to all data access.

### 5. **Database Passwords Visible** ⏱️ 5 minutes
**What it means:** Your database password is saved in a file that could be shared.
